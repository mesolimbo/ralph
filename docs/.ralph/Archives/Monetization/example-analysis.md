# Example Mini-SPA Analysis

## Summary
Both examples demonstrate exceptional quality with zero external dependencies.

### Key Patterns to Replicate:
1. **Self-contained**: Single HTML file with inline CSS/JS/SVG
2. **Documentation**: 100+ line header with user guide, dev guide, keyboard shortcuts
3. **CSS Architecture**: 15+ numbered sections with design tokens (custom properties)
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA - keyboard nav, ARIA, 4.5:1 contrast, reduced motion
5. **State Management**: Observable pattern with subscribe/setState/getState
6. **Animations**: GPU-composited (transform/opacity only), spring easing, staggered timing
7. **Responsive**: 3 breakpoints (desktop/tablet/mobile)
8. **Polish**: Themes, easter eggs, noscript fallback, focus management

### File Sizes
- inventory.html: 3,041 lines (~135 KB, ~16 KB gzip) - Advanced orbital chart
- minesweeper.html: 932 lines (~33 KB, ~9 KB gzip) - Retro game

### Quality Bar
- Comprehensive inline documentation
- Semantic HTML with ARIA landmarks
- Custom state management (no frameworks)
- Multiple interaction modes
- Professional animation timing
- Production-ready accessibility
